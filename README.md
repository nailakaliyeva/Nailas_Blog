The blog is user friendly and pretty intuitive. I'm using a free Mailgun API to send recovery emails to users 
who have forgotten their passwords. When it comes to resetting passwords, there are a couple of things 
users should know if they run into an error after clicking 'Request Password Reset' button 
(only for Gmail users):
1. You need to allow access to less secure apps to be able to receive a password recovery email from the website

2. Try unblocking your IP (sometimes it gets blocked by Google) by visiting [https://accounts.google.com/DisplayUnlockCaptcha](https://accounts.google.com/DisplayUnlockCaptcha)
